# Family Care Circle Monorepo for Web + Mobile

## üì¶ Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `moti` for animations
- `nativewind v4` for universal theming/design
- Next.js 14
- Expo SDK 50
- Expo Router 3
- Storybook 7 for documentation and testing of components

## üëì How NativeWind works with Solito

### Fast on every platform

NativeWind lets you use Tailwind while reducing runtime work on every platform.

### iOS and Android

Most approaches to using Tailwind in React Native do something like this at runtime:

```ts
const styles = props.className
  .split(' ')
  .map((className) => makeStyle(className))

return <View style={styles} />
```

This means that every component ends up parsing strings to construct predictable style objects.

NativeWind takes a new approach by doing this work upfront with a Babel plugin.

NativeWind turns `className` strings into cached `StyleSheet.create` objects at build time, avoiding the [slow string parsing problem](https://twitter.com/terrysahaidak/status/1470735820915150850?s=20&t=w9VUPwiTFxBkRBHWTtDz1g) of libraries like `styled-components/native`.

Keep in mind that the Babel plugin will get used on iOS/Android only; on Web, we don't need the plugin since we are using `className`.

### Web

On Web, NativeWind uses Next.js' `PostCSS` feature to output CSS StyleSheets.

Which means that **on Web, you're using CSS class names.**

Yes, that's right. We aren't parsing className strings into objects for React Native Web to use. Instead, we're actually forwarding CSS classnames to the DOM. That means you can get responsive styles, dark mode support, & pseudo-selectors _with server-side rendering support_.

This is finally possible with the release of React Native Web 0.18.

As a result, using NativeWind with React Native doesn't have significant overhead compared to plain old Tailwind CSS in a regular React app.

If you're planning on making a website with Tailwind, why not use Solito with NativeWind?

You might accidentally make a great native app when you thought you were just making a website.

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `app` you'll be creating files inside of `apps/expo/app` to use file system routing on iOS and Android.
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `design` your app's design system.
    - `ui` the shared components for web + native. These are the building blocks of the app.
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`
  - Runs `yarn next`
- Expo local dev:
  - First, build a dev client onto your device or simulator
    - `cd apps/expo`
    - Then, either `expo run:ios`, or `eas build`
  - After building the dev client, from the root of the monorepo...
    - `yarn native` (This runs `expo start --dev-client`)

## üÜï Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `apps/expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated

cd ../..
yarn
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).
